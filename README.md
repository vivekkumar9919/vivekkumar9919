## 🧠 What I Focus On

> _"Build systems that scale — not just work."_

- 🏗 Designing backend flows with reliability and performance in mind  
- 🛠 Refactoring legacy code to adopt clean, modular patterns  
- 🔍 Debugging deep production issues (logs are my best friend)  
- 📊 Handling high-volume data operations with efficiency  
- 🧪 Writing meaningful tests and safe deployment routines

## 🧩 Code Style & Patterns

> I love writing code that other devs want to read.

- Follows principles of **Clean Architecture** and **Separation of Concerns**
- Uses **modular patterns**: each component has a single responsibility
- Keeps logs verbose in dev, meaningful in prod
- Prefers `async/await` over callback hell
- Champions **config-driven** logic and reusable utility methods


---

## 🔍 Debugging is 🔑

- Always logs request body, URL, and responses for traceability
- Uses log aggregators like **Coralogix** to slice through errors
- Knows how to find the *needle in a haystack* (even across services)

---

## 🌱 Currently Growing

- Diving into relational DB query optimization
- Studying **system design patterns** & **DDD principles**
- Exploring **open-source contributions** and scalable infra
